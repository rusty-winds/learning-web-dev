Synchronous code - code executes line by line in the order writter
IO operations work outside js context and memory and hence take a lot of time and are uncertain to be executed.
Synchronous , Asynchronous , Concurrent  ... are 3 types of code
js code by default runs on single thread
Asynchronous code make working with IO commands better as the thread can work on other things rather than waiting on IO command to finish.
Compute heavy task take full time as the single thread is busy solving them before moving on.
JS can have functions as argument for other functions.

fs.readFile('a.txt','utf-8',print) this is an async function here 3rd argument calls to an print function which needs to be in a format of following
function print(err,data){  //here err nedds to be first and second is where data would be stored on executing fs.readFile object 
 console.log(data);
}  // in this function we can define whatever we want to with the read data when the task finished we can pass a function in the function which uses data

Assignment for the class 
            try promisified of 
                set timeout
                fetch
                fs.read
